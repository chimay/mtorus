#+STARTUP: showall

If you ever dreamed about creating and switching buffer groups at will
in emacs, MTorus is the tool you want.

This repository is of fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtorus.berlios/

Note that :

  - A buffer group is called a ring

  - The set of all buffer groups is called the torus (a ring of rings)

In short, this plugin let you organize your buffers by creating as
many buffer groups as you need, and quickly navigate between :

  - Buffers of the same group

  - Buffer groups (rings)

The original project seems to be at rest by now, so Iâ€™ve mirrored it
here in case I would need to tweak it.


* Done

What has been done :

  - Change buffer by name with mtorus-switch-to-marker

    + Inspired by mtorus-switch-to-ring

    + Both functions work well with Helm

  - Persistent torus : save buffers *filenames* of the torus to a file with mtorus-save-torus

    + In the previous version, only *buffer names* were saved, which is
      not sufficient to restore files located in multiple directories

  - Added remassoc : needed by mtorus-delete-ring


* Configuration

* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
