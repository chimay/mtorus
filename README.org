Mirror of https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtorus.berlios/

In short, MTorus let you organize your buffers in emacs by creating
as many buffer groups as you need, and quickly navigate between :

  - Buffer groups, called buffer rings

  - Buffers of the same group

The torus is simply the ring of buffer rings.

The project seems to be at rest by now, so Iâ€™ve just mirrored it here
in case I would need to tweak it.

What has been done :

  - Added remassoc : needed by mtorus-delete-ring


* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
